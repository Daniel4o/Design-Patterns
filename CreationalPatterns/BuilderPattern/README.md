<h1>Builder Design Pattern</h1>

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you ***construct*** complex ***objects step by step***. The pattern allow you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction mode.

<h2>Example</h2>
We have 3 builders. One that builds everything from wood and glass, the second one builds everything with stone and iron and the third that uses gold and diamonds.
<br>By calling the same set of steps you get a regular house from the first builder, a small castle from the second builder and a palace from the third.</br>
However, this would only work if the client code that calls the building steps is able to interact with builders using a common interface.

<ol>
<li>

**Builder** interface declares product construction steps that are common to all types of builders.
</li>
<li>

**Concrete Builders** provide different implementations of the construction steps.
</li>
<li>

**Products** are resulting objects.
</li>
<li>

**Director** class defines the order in which to call construction steps, so you can create and reuse specific configurations of products.
</li>
<li>

**Client** must associate one of the bulder objects with the director.
</li>
</ol>
<h2>When to use Builder Pattern</h2>
<ul>
<li>When you want to build an object from a bunch of other objects;</li>
<li>When you want the creation of these parts to be independent of the main object;</li>
<li>When you want to hide the creation of the parts from the client so both arenâ€™t dependent;</li>
<li>When the builder knows the specifics and nobody else does.</li>
</ul>
