<ol>
<li>

**Prototype** interface declares the cloning methods- **clone()**
</li>
<li>

**Concrete Prototype** implements the cloning method to copy the original objectâ€™s data to the clone.
</li>
<li>

**Client** can produce a copy of any object that follows the prototype interface.

</ol>
<h2>When to use Prototype Pattern</h2>
<ul>
<li>

When the classes are **instantiated at runtime**;
</li>
<li>

When the **cost of creating object is expensive or complicated**;
</li>
<li>

When you want the **number of classes** in an app **to be minimum**;
</li>
<li>

When the **client** application **needs to be unaware** of object creation and representation.
</li>
</ul>
