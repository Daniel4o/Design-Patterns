<h1>Design Patterns</h1>

Design Patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. **They are** like pre-made **blueprints** that you can customize to solve a recurring design problem in your code.
The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem.
<h2>Details of Design Pattern</h2>
<ul>
<li>

 ***Intent*** of the pattern briefly **describes** both the **problem and the solution**;
</li>
<li>

***Motivation*** **further explains** the **problem and** the **solution** the pattern makes possible;
</li>
<li>

***Structure*** of classes **shows each part of the pattern** and how they are related;
</li>
<li>

***Code example*** **makes it easier to grasp the idea** behind the pattern
</li>    
<br>Other useful details, include applicability of the pattern, implementation steps and relations with other patterns.</br>
</ul>
<h2>Classification of Design Patterns</h2>

Design patterns had originally categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on what kind of problem they solve.
<ol>
<li>
Creational Patterns provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way.
</li>
<li>
Structural Patterns are organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.
</li>
<li>
Behavioral Patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
